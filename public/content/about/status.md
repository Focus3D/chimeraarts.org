## Membership

<div class="alert alert-success">Chimera is currently <strong>open for membership in our mini-makerspace</strong> in the back lot of the Ford Garage building in downtown Sebastopol.</div>

Our main space at Chimera is undergoing construction and should be open in a few months (*no, we don't have a specific date yet, sorry!*). 

The current mini-makerspace is an office building that is about 700 sq.ft. This space is great for anyone doing small arts and crafts, jewelry, software or hardware design or anyone working on a computer or who doesn't require a lot of space to work. 

If you're looking to work on large projects, you may want to wait to join until that space opens up.

## Fiscal Sponsorship

Chimera is fiscally sponsored by [Sebastopol Center for the Arts](http://sebarts.org/) which is the organization that allows us to accept charitable donations.
