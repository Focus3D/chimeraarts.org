## Not in the list?

For items not in the list above, **we require a member to take responsibility for the item**. The reason we do this is so that we don't end up with a lot of things that aren't used and just take up space and collect dust.

Post your item in our [**Google Group**][google-group] or reach out to a member who might be interested in taking responsibility for your item.
