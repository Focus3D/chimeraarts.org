title: "Chimera's Space"

Our main space when we first moved in.

Chimera is renting a 5,000 sq.ft. space at the old Ford Garage building in downtown Sebastopol in addition to an office unit in the back of the same lot.

The main space is undergoing renovations and is slated to be complete before the end of 2013. When the main space construction is complete, Chimera will open up it's membership offerings including our metal shop and studio rentals.

Our office space in the back lot is our space for our regular meetups, classes and events. We're also in the process of preparing it for regular use by members.
