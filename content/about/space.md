Chimera is renting a 5,000 sq.ft. space at the old Ford Garage building in downtown Sebastopol in addition to an office unit in the back of the same lot.

*The main space is undergoing renovations and is slated to be ready in the beginning of 2014*. When the main space construction is complete, Chimera will open up it's membership offerings including our metal shop and studio rentals.

Our office space in the back lot is our space for regular meetups, classes, events, and as of December 2013, membership!

The **current mini-makerspace is an office building that is about 700 sq.ft**. This space is great for anyone doing small arts and crafts, jewelry, software or hardware design or anyone working on a computer or who doesn't require a lot of space to work. 

**Curious about what equipment and tools we have?** Check out our [list of equipment](/about/equipment/).

*If this sounds interesting to you, learn more about [membership](/membership/).*

If you're looking to work on large projects, you may want to wait to join until that space opens up.
