### Donating Equipment

If you have equipment that you'd like to donate, please have a look at our [Wish List page](/wish-list/) to see what we're in need of and how equipment donations work at Chimera.


### Donating Money

**Money burning a hole through your pocket?** Chimera is always happy to receive cash donations!

[Please go here to donate to Chimera!](https://chimera.nationbuilder.com/donate)

Your cash donation will go to helping us pay for rent and utilities, purchase equipment and supplies and put on events, meetups and classes!


### Volunteering

**Don't have things or money to donate but want to help?** We're always looking for people to help us clean and move things, produce events and 

Have a particular skill? Then you might want to consider [teaching at Chimera]()


### Tax Receipt

Since we're a 501\(c\)3 organization, we can offer tax receipts for donations we accept and that are valued. 

*If you want a tax receipt for your donation, please let us know otherwise no receipt will be issued!*
