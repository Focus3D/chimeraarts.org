## Equipment

**Got something awesome you want us to have?** If you have equipment that you'd like to donate, please have a look at our [Wish List page](/wish-list/) to see what we're in need of and how equipment donations work at Chimera.


## Money

**Money burning a hole through your pocket?** Chimera is always happy to receive cash donations!

**[Please go here to donate to Chimera!](https://chimera.nationbuilder.com/donate)**

Your cash donation will go to helping us pay for rent and utilities, purchase equipment and supplies and put on events, meetups and classes!


## Volunteering

**Don't have things or money to donate but want to help?** We're always looking for people to help us clean and move things, produce events and 

**Have a particular skill?** Then you might want to consider [teaching at Chimera](/about/teaching/).


## Reimbursements

Chimera does not offer any reimbursements for donations. If you'd like to donate something to Chimera and want something in return, the only thing we can offer is a tax receipt (and our thanks!).


## Tax Receipt

Since we're a 501\(c\)3 organization, we can offer tax receipts for valid donations we accept and that are valued. Tax receipts are for relatively large donations. If you donate some post-its(R), we're not going to give you a tax receipt.

*If you want a tax receipt for your donation, please let us know otherwise no receipt will be issued!*
