## Professional Experience

My current career has been in manufacturing test engineering since about 2005.  I've designed test equipment and currently push 1's and 0's around to run test racks.  I work in the solar energy industry.


## Other Interests

I invariably balance my bicycle at red lights, enjoy my neighbor's home brew and like watching cats.  (They move so unnaturally!)  On the creative side, I've made great cat 'furniture',  stout human furniture and recently a quadruped creature costume that occasionally walks through Sebastopol.

I'd really like to revive my rusty micro-processor and welding skills.  My next big projects will be Daft Punk helmets and a bamboo bicycle.

I'd really like to connect to creative local people.
