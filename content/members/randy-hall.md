A transplant from Silicon Valley, Randy has been into technology his entire life. From his first Apple II Plus, loading games from his 5.25-inch floppy drives, all the way to working for high technology giant Intel (when it was still small enough to be called "Little Blue") for over 15 years, Randy has seen Silicon Valley come of age, and then some. He doesn't do that anymore, as he found that the Silicon Valley lifestyle was shortening the quality of his life, and so in 2006 he took the biggest risk of his life and moved to Sonoma County with his family.

You might ask, "what does this have to do with film?" to which Randy replies, "have you seen how movies are made recently?"

Despite his software engineering background and high-tech pedigree, he recently trained at the [San Francisco School of Digital Filmmaking](http://filmschoolsf.com "Soon to be called 'Film School SF'") in an intensive 12-month filmmaking program, which, when combined with his decades of South Bay living and deep knowledge of technology, digital marketing, and business, instantly turned the light on for him. He's now building his production company one client at a time, with a blend of storytelling and visual effects.

From 2007 to 2012, Randy produced and co-hosted a wine industry-related radio/podcast program called [Wine Biz Radio](http://winebizradio.com) along with his best buddies Rick "Kaz" Kasmier and Christophe "X" Smith. They have dreams of a reunion tour, but honestly, they need their time apart from each other.

In 2013, back when Chimera was still an toddler, Randy produced and directed a short film for the [48 Hour Film Project Santa Rosa](http://www.48hourfilm.com/en/santarosa/ "Just this little film project thing") along with a group of volunteers and headquartered at the Chimera Art Space.

Lately, Randy has started a new podcast, much in the same vein as Wine Biz Radio, but about the film industry. He hosts it along with a fine young gentleman in San Francisco named Ben Yennie, with the working title of "Film Insight: The Producer Foundry Podcast". Yes, it's something of a mouthful, and they're still working on it.

When he grows up, Randy wants to be the ultimate Renaissance Man, moving freely between the realms of art, science, philosophy, business, and politics with an ease unknown to common people. But in the meantime, he's down for film projects, reawakening the wounded software development child inside him, and hacking on electronics, while learning to build laser cutters and CNC mills and 3D printers, all from scratch (if he has anything to say about it!)
