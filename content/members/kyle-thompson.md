Kyle Thompson is a metal fabricator who honed his skills in some of the harshest environments and working with the toughest deadlines. 

Kyle has been building custom motorcycles with [Kraus Motor Company](http://www.krausmotorco.com/) since 2009.  His work on the Bolide bike helped take home the AMD Championship in 2011, winning 1st place in North America and 3rd place in the world. In further pursuit of his interest in art installation, Kyle joined Burning Man’s [DPW Metal Shop Crew](http://www.burningman.com/on_the_playa/infrastructure/dpw.html) in 2012 and helped create a city of 50,000 plus participants and artists. 

When Kyle is not in the desert or at the Kraus Motor Company shop in the redwood forests of Cazadero, he’s at Chimera Art Space working on creating Sonoma County's first ever communal [fabrication art facility](http://chimeraarts.org/fab/).
