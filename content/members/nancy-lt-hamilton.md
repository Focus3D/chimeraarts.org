I’m Nancy L. T. Hamilton (middle initials stand for Lee Tool or as others will testify, the L. T. stands for “Loose Tongue”) and I am a jeweler, a jewelry designer and an artist.  I create jewelry that I call  “modern romantic”.   My jewelry tells stories.

I use a variety of different materials in creating my work.  The design dictates the type of material that is used.

I create educational videos and content that you can find [on my website](http://www.nancylthamilton.com/) and [my YouTube channel](http://www.youtube.com/user/nancylthamilton)
