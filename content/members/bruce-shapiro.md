Trained for and practiced internal medicine for five years, before discovering what was to become a lifelong obsession with connecting things that move to a computer. My first experiments with stepper motors in 1990 resulted in Eggbot-- a spherical plotter for decorating my kids' Easter eggs.  Twenty years later I teamed up with Evil Mad Science Laboratories, which led to its release as an [open-source project](http://egg-bot.com/) and popular seller on their site.  

My continued fascination with motion control branched into art and educational uses-- as artist-in-residence at the Science Museum of Minnesota, 2001-4, I taught classes (kids building and programming their Eggbots) and worked on NSF-funded grants creating exhibits.  During the same period, I began ongoing series of large scale motion control sculptures that have been permanently installed in science centers in the US, Canada, Europe, and  Australia.  More info on both the educational and art sides of my work can be found [on my site](http://taomc.com/).

Most recently, I have discovered (and fallen deeply in love) with makerspaces, starting as a member of [The Mill](http://www.mnmill.org/) in Minneapolis and then as one of the founders of [Nordeast Makers](http://nordeastmakers.com/) in St. Paul.  Now that my wife and I have moved out to Sebastopol, I am delighted to find Chimera and its wonderful community-- my hope is to continue both making, teaching and learning here!
