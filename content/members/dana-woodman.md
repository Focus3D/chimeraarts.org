Hi, I'm Dana.

I started Chimera in early 2012 because I felt a need for a community arts and makerspace in Sonoma County. I had been making art out of my small apartment and was growing frustrated by the lack of space and a dire need for a community of people I could get inspired by. I'm always blow away by the talented and passionate people in this area.


## Professional Experience

I've been a software developer since 2004, specializing in web development and front-end design. I can write in a multitude of languages including Ruby, Python, Go, and JavaScript. 

I also have some experience writing software for interactive projects, including writing the software that runs the Chimera RFID security system.

You can learn more about me [on my website](http://danawoodman.com).


## Other Interests

I'm fascinated by micro electronics (Arduino, Raspberry Pi, etc...), 3D printing, laser cutting, fabrication (welding, CNC, woodworking) and a ton of other things. 

I've collaborated with [TouchFab](http://touchfabdesign.com/) to build an interactive light sculpture called the [Light Cloud](http://cloud.touchfabdesign.com/). It was one of the more challenging and rewarding projects I've been a part of.


## How I Can Help

If you've got a project that involves software, I'd love to lend a hand or at least give some guidance.

Feel free to shoot me an email at [dana@chimeraarts.org](mailto:dana@chimeraarts.org).
