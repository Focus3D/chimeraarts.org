As of January 30th, we have **collected $1,570** out of our **goal of $12,000**.


## The Plan

The general game plan is this:

- We are looking for a space that meets our needs for a fabrication facility (see Space Requirements below)
- We are attempting to raise at least $12,000 to pay for the space and a few months of operating costs.
- If we don't meet that goal in a reasonable time frame, we will refund people's money.
- The space is intended as a fabrication shop and may include the following activities and tools:
    - Welding
    - CNC milling
    - Plasma cutting
    - Lathe
    - Break
    - Pipe bender
    - Table saw
    - Drill press
    - General power tools
    - Hand tools
    - Work benches
    - Project storage
    - And more...
- If we find a space and raise the money, we will cash the checks and start the process of renting, which will require the following expenses:
    - Use permit (if needed)
    - First/last month rent
    - Setup costs (repairs, walls, etc)
    - Other fees
- *Without your help, this won't happen: Get Involved!*


## Space Requirements

Below is a list of the requirements we have for a space:

- At or less than $2,000/month lease

## Getting Involved

### Pre-Pay for Membership

The most important way you can get involved is to pre-pay for membership. We're asking for **$300 from each interested individual**, but you can of course donate more to the cause if you really want to see this project happen. By pre-paying for membership, your money will go towards your first 3 months of membership and setup costs. 

***To pre-pay for membership, please email us at [info@chimeraarts.org](mailto:info@chimeraarts.org) with the subject "Fabrication Shop Membership".***

If we do not reach our goal in a sufficient timeline, we will refund your money. You can also request us to refund your money any time before we settle on a space (we will let you know before we cash checks!). But remember, this is a big undertaking and will take time; please be patient.


### Doante

If you don't have the money to pre-pay for membership, but want to help us, **please consider [donating](/donate/)**.


### Find a Space

We also need help finding the right location. Check out our list of requirements above and help us search for spaces. Good places to look are [Craigslist](http://sfbay.craigslist.org/search/off/nby?zoomToPosting=&catAbb=off&query=&minAsk=&maxAsk=2000&minSqft=2000&maxSqft=&nh=103&nh=105&hasPic=1&excats=) and [Keegan & Coppin](http://www.keegancoppin.com/)
