## Membership FAQ


### What Equipment Do You Have?

Check out our [Equipment page](/about/equipment/) for an updated list of our equipment.


### What Volunteer Commitment Are You Looking For?

We don't have a hard requirement on volunteering. We want members to take the initiative to find things that need to be done at Chimera. 

If the trash needs to be taken out, then take it out. If a station is messy, clean it up. If you need a piece of equipment, then help us acquire it. If you want to start doing X at Chimera, then make it happen (as long as it's relatively safe and legal)!

We operate on the honor code; we're not going to track your hours. 


### What Membership Commitment Do You Require?

At this time, we don't require any membership commitment though we ask you to give us a heads up if you're going to cancel.


### What Is The Cancellation Policy?

You can cancel at any time with no penalty. If you cancel within the first 5 days of a new month we will refund your money.

If you'd like to cancel your membership, please [email us](mailto:info@chimeraarts.org)


### Are There Any Setup Fees

At this point, there are no setup fees to become a member. We may decide to change this in the future if we deem it necessary.


### Are There Any Other Fees?

If you loose your RFID card, it will cost you $10 to replace it.
